Switchboard is a web phone interface that allows you to manage incoming and outgoing calls for the staff of a company. It uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to manage telephone calls over a data network, such as the Internet.

Switchboard works with [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/), a private branch exchange (PBX), so it connects a certain number of communication terminals, such as telephones or fax machines, to each other and to the public telephone network.

With Switchboard, people in all departments of a company can stay connected, handling calls from different offices as local calls. It will be easy for operators to keep track of the calls they make, having the conversations recorded for reference.

## Integrations


1. **Phone Service Provider:** As you might assume, we need to integrate a phone service provider, who will be responsible for handling incoming and outgoing calls from your **Switchboard Cloud** phone application. The main providers that offer these services are: Twilio, Flowroute, Lingo Telecom, and others. You only need to integrate one of them for your Phone System to operate normally.


2. **Microsoft 365**: Your Microsoft 365 account will be used for the purpose of importing your contact list from it. However, there will be options in the phone application available to create contacts from there.

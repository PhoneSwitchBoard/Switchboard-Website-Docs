## Main configuration variables for your interface


Once you log in to your interface, go to the `Interface Config` menu option.

You will find a List of Uninitialized Configuration Properties, on the left of the page, with those properties that you must set, one time, so that your phone system is correctly configured to be able to make phone calls.

Below is a list where you will find all the configuration variables, with a description that explains the purpose of each in the operation of the system, along with an example value for each of them.

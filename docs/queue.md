## Queue configuration


To add yourself, as the current Agent, to one of the existing queues, you can use the `Add to Queue` option in the left menu.

Also, you can add other agents to the queues from the `Add to Queue` button, which you find to the right of the agent name, in the agent list.

Note that an Agent can be _Paused_ or _Active_ in a queue, and you can manage it from the list of queues in the dashboard.

## Fill a Call Record

Once you have finished a call, you can fill out the call details. We recommend that you do it as soon as the call ends, this way you will have fresh all the important details you want to keep about the conversation you just had. This will allow your company to locate calls, and keep in mind that you can search for them years later. That is the importance of filling out call records.

By filling out a Call Record you will have the recording of the call available for reference.

You will receive an email every time you fill out a Call Record, with all the feedback details included in the comments. This way, if you ever want to search for a conversation by topic, we recommend searching using your email client's filters.

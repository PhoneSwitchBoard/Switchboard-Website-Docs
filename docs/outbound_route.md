## Outbound Routes


Outbound Routes are available in the Menu option `Asterisk Settings` -> `Outbound Routes`, only for administrator users.

An **outbound route** is used to tell the **PBX** how to process outbound calls and which **trunk** to use. Every time a user dials a number, the **PBX** will compare the dialed number with different patterns that we have defined as Rules or Outbound Routes.

If a pattern matches, the **PBX** will route the call out using the associated **trunk**. If it doesn't match, the **PBX** will try to match the dialed number with the pattern on the next defined Rule.
